# ETF Analyzer Web App


This jupyter notebook creates a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

The database is contained in the accompanying 'etf.db' file

The application analyzes the daily returns of the ETF stocks both individually and as a whole. 

#### Analyze a Single Asset in the ETF

Using SQL queries with Python, Pandas, and hvPlot we analyze the performance of a single asset from the ETF.

#### Analyze the ETF Portfolio

Build the ETF portfolio by using SQL joins to combine all the data for each asset and then evaluate its performance.

#### Deploy the Notebook as a Web Application
